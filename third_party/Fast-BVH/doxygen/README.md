Fast-BVH
========

Welcome to the documentation for the Fast-BVH project.
Here you'll find reference to the various structures and interfaces,
as well as some tutorials to help you get started.

If you're here for reference material, you can go ahead and checkout the two main classes:

 - @ref FastBVH::BuildStrategy
 - @ref FastBVH::BVH
 - @ref FastBVH::Traverser

If you're here to learn, you can checkout out the [Getting Started](doxygen/GettingStarted.md) page.
